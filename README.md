# Love Japan

Love Japan is an image sharing website all about Japan. Users can register an account to upload their images and comment to start a discussion on others.

The website aims to bring together anyone with an interest or love of anything Japanese. Images can be anything from anime, art, cooking, cars, clothes, cities, nature, any object or thing that has a relationship to Japan itself.

The Notification Model was added later, as I thought it necessary to have a way to inform registered users of comment and image post approval decisions.
