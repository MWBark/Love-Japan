# Love Japan

Love Japan is an image sharing website all about Japan. Users can register an account to upload their images and comment to start a discussion on others.

The website aims to bring together anyone with an interest or love of anything Japanese. Images can be anything from anime, art, cooking, cars, clothes, cities, nature, any object or thing that has a relationship to Japan itself.

The Notification Model was added later, as I thought it necessary to have a way to inform registered users of comment and image post approval decisions.

### Agile Methodology

Github Issues were used to create User Stories to plan actions to take in the project. Issues contained acceptance criteria to guide me in creating features and knowing when they were completed.

5 issues from the back catalog, with MoSCoW 'must have' ranking or highest available, were then put into a sprint/milestone to create a project iteration. Within the sprint, 3 issues (60%) were labeled 'must have' while the other 2 were labeled 'should have' or 'could have'.

The issues from the sprint were then added to a 'LoveJapan Sprint #' Project board 'Todo' column. Issues were then, by priority, moved to the 'In Progress' and then 'Done' coloumn on completion. Any issues not completed before the sprint/iteration deadline were added back to the back catalog for reprioritisation.
